# Colour Matrix Recognization
This project implemented an algorithm to recognize the colours of a given image.

## Images
The given images are in folder `\images1`.
One example is like:
![proj_4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d89309c9-6cae-47f1-a2ce-f7cfd310f86e)

The images are 4x4 matrixs of different colours, and the matrixs might be noised, rotated and even projected.



## Algorithm and Results
The algorithm in `ColourMatrix.py` is aiming to recognize the colours in the matrixs and print the results.

The details could refer to my report `report.pdf`.
Part of my results:
